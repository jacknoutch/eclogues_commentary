Tityrus, a slave overseer of a farm, has been to Rome to buy his freedom, seen Augustus, and received permission to remain on his land. He meets Meliboeus a shepherd who has been turned out. The Eclogue consists of the laments of Meliboeus and the gratitude of Tityrus.
The poem is a rather crude allegory. In 42 B.C. when Octavianus returned after the victory of Philippi he distributed lands to the soldiers. He took the lands of the neighbourhood of Cremona and Mantua, dispossessing the owners. One of these was Vergil, who lived at Andes near Mantua. Vergil by help of Asinius Polio (then governor of Gallia Transpadana), and others, went to Rome and recovered his farm from Octavianus. This poem he wrote in gratitude. For fuller explanation of the circumstances see Dates of the Eclogues, above, p. 9.
[1–5. Meliboeus. You lie at ease and sing of your love: I am driven into exile.]

5. ‘teach the woodland to reecho the fair Amaryllis’, i.e. the shepherd sings or calls upon his love, and the woods reecho the name.
The acc. Amaryllida is a kind of internal or extended cognate like agere Antiopen, saltare Cyclopa, vox hominem sonat.
[6–10. Tit. Thanks to him to whom I shall always sacrifice as a god.]
6. deus is Octavianus. To speak of Octavianus as a god to whom lambs will be sacrificed is at this date probably only a half playful exaggeration; but afterwards of course the emperor Augustus was regularly deified, and even in the Georgics (I. 34) Vergil speaks of the signs of the Zodiac crowding up to make room for Augustus.
The sacrifice is further explained (43) as being 12 days every year, evidently referring to the offerings on the first of every month to the household gods or Lares.
9. meas errare boves permisit, unusual poetic construction, acc. inf. after permitto: the ordinary prose constr. is ut and subj.
ludo, often used half modestly for poetry: carmina qui lusi pastorum Georg. IV. 567; iuvenilia lusi Ov. Trist. v. 1, 7.
[11–19. Mel. I don’t grudge it. There is trouble all over; I am tired, sick, driving my goats, one lately a mother: I ought to have known what that thunder meant!]
12. usque adeo turbatur, ‘such trouble there is’, impers. pass. He is speaking of the suffering and confusion caused by the confiscation of the lands and allotment to the veterans. See introduction.
The poor Meliboeus then (with a touch of dramatic pathos) laments his own troubles: he has to go on and on (protenus): he is sick and tired (aeger): one of his she goats he can hardly pull by a cord (duco vix) having left the new-born twin kids on the hard stones (silice). Then with rustic superstition he adds ‘he might have known the coming trouble, from seeing the oaks struck by lightning’.
13. protenus, ‘on and on’: expressing his weariness.
14–15. The goat had given birth to (conixa ‘travailed’ for the commoner enixa) two kids among the nut bushes on the stony soil. There is a touch of pity in a silice in nuda; the little things had to die, as they must be left behind: but they might at least have had soft moss or grass to die on!
16. si mens non laeva fuisset, elliptical use of the conditional common in all colloquial speech: he means ‘I remember the prophecy and might have expected this misfortune had I not been blind’.
17. de caelo tactas, ‘struck from heaven’, picturesque (perhaps augurial) phrase for lightning. Old authorities tell us that the striking of different trees portended different misfortunes, the oak being a sign of exile.
memini praedicere, ‘I remember that they foretold’, the pres. inf. being the regular idiom when the thing remembered is part of the person’s own experience, as here.
19. da, ‘tell’: just as accipio is used both in prose and poetry for ‘hear’.
[Before this line a spurious verse ‘saepe sinistra cava praedixit ab ilice cornix’ has got into the text from IX. 15.]
[20–26. Tit. I used to think Rome a small town like ours: it is quite big.]
20. The dramatic colour is kept up. Tityrus tells his story in a roundabout rustic style.
21. huic nostrae, Mantua, near which (at the village of Andes) was Vergil’s home.
22. depellere, ‘drive down’ to ‘our town’ Mantua.
23. i.e. I thought Mantua was to Rome just as kids are to goats, puppies to dogs, or any other little things to big ones.
26. lenta viburna, ‘pliant osiers’.
[27–36. M. What took you to Rome? Tit. To get freedom, now that I have left Galatea and love Amaryllis.]
28. ‘Freedom, which though late has cast her eyes upon the sluggard’. A slave might buy his freedom: but as long as he was bound to his first love Galatea, he was slow (iners) to buy it, for all his savings were squandered. Now he has a new love Amaryllis, evidently more thrifty: so he has saved up and been to Rome to buy his freedom.
sera tamen respexit, abridged neat phrase (like the Greek use with ὅμως) for ‘though late, yet has looked upon me’.
29. postquam, with imperfect (or present, 31) in its proper precise use, dating the beginning of the new habit or state of things.
33. peculi, slaves were allowed to have private money, called peculium. They were also allowed to marry, (though not a legal recognised conubium): but Vergil is here thinking less of the life of Roman slaves and more of the free loves of Sicilian shepherds.
35. pinguis, ‘rich’: perhaps what we call cream-cheese; anyhow good of its kind.
ingratae, playful indignation: the city did not pay him as much as he wanted for his cheeses.
[37–46. M. I wondered why Amaryllis was so sad. Tit. I had to go. At Rome I saw the youth who gave me leave to stay on my land.]
37. Mel. playfully apostrophises the absent Amaryllis, who, in her sorrow for having to part from Tityrus, calls on the gods and leaves her apples ungathered.
39–40. He tells Tityrus, with playful exaggeration, that not Amaryllis only, but the very springs and trees regretted his absence.
39. aberat, a long. The -at of imperf. was originally long, and Vergil occasionally uses it so (tho’ usually in a pause) from fondness for archaic forms. Ennius has ‘ponebat ante salutem’: Plautus has it long. So G. IV. 137, A. V. 853, VII. 174 &c.
41. quid facerem? past deliberative: ‘what was I to do?’
42. praesentes, idiomatically used, with gods, to mean ‘powerful’. e.g. praesentia numina Fauni G. I. 10, si quid praesentius audes A. XII. 152, praesentius auxilium G. II. 127.
alibi goes with both clauses, the sense being ‘I had to go to Rome, for nowhere else could I either &c.’
43. iuvenem, Octavianus: the figure—the shepherd buying his freedom—is inextricably mixed up with the thing figured—the poet receiving his lands back from Augustus. The slave goes to Rome to buy his freedom; but when he gets there he sees not his master but Augustus; and instead of buying his freedom he receives permission not to leave his home.
46. submittite, ‘rear’, the regular word, cf. Georg. III. 75, in spem submittere gentis.
[47–59. M. Happy man, you will keep your farm, and, poor tho’ the land be, you will be happy in the familiar life, the sights and sounds of the country.]
The sense is:—
48. ‘Tho’ the bare rock mars all your pasture, and the swamp covers them with the muddy rush’, obducat being more appropriate to the last sentence, in which it occurs—the figure zeugma.
50. graves fetas, ‘the pregnant ewes’.
[fetus also means ‘having given birth’ and some take it so here translating graves ‘weakly’ ‘slow’: but the other is the proper meaning of gravis, and fetus too. So A. 11. 237, machina feta armis, of the wooden horse with soldiers inside.]
52–59. This pretty passage shews well Vergil’s inborn love of the country.
53- frigus opacum, ‘the cool shade’; sacros, as every spring or rill had its god, or nymph.
54. quae semper, ‘as ever’, ‘as of old’, ab limite, ‘on the border’, like a latere, a tergo, a dextra.
55. ‘its willow blossom rifled by the Hyblaean bees’.
Hyblaeis, the bees of Hybla in Sicily were famous, and this is what is called the ‘literary’ use of epithets: wine is called ‘Massic’ or ‘Falernian’, marble is ‘Parian’, the arrow is ‘Cydonian', the bow is ‘Parthian’, &c. not so much to specify the kind, as to remind the reader of the Greek poets who speak of them.
florem depasta, might be acc. of respect; but considering Vergil's usage, it is much more probably the Greek use of acc. of the object after the perf. passive, really an elastic extension of the active construction to the passive voice.
Thus the Greeks say:
Active
ἐπιτρέπω σοὶ τὴν ἀρχήν
ἐγγράφω τῇ δέλτῳ ξυνθήματα 
Passive
ἐπιτέτραψαι τὴν ἀρχήν
δέλτος ἐγγεγραμμένη ξυνθήματα
This usage the Roman poets imitated, as well as the acc. after the middle, which they very likely did not distinguish from the other. Other instances of the acc. after passive are fusus barbam A. X. 838: inscripti nomina regum Ecl. ΙΙΙ. 106: per pedes traiectus lora A. ΙΙ. 272: caesariem effusae G. IV. 337: caeruleos implexae crinibus angues G. IV. 482.
56. Notice the soothing whispering sound, produced by the sibilants and liquids, to imitate or suggest the thing described. So Tenny- son's famous lines in the Princess:
‘The moan of doves in immemorial elm
and murmur of innumerable bees.’
57. frondator, the ‘pruner’ or ‘dresser’ had much to do, we are told in Georg. II. 397—419: he clipped the bushes and willows, ‘leafed’ the elms to let the sun in on the grapes, pruned the vines, and plucked leaves for fodder.
58–59. palumbes. Mr Fowler, in his careful chapter on the Birds of Vergil, identifies the palumbes with two species, the wood-pigeon and the stock-dove: ‘Perhaps the stock-dove is the more likely of the two to have been the bird generally meant: but it is quite possible that Romans confounded the two species’ (A year with the birds, p. 115).
59. turtur is the turtle-dove: ‘it is still found in small numbers passing the summer and breeding in Italy, and is most frequent in the subalpine region of which Vergil is here writing’ (ib. p. 113).
[60–64.  Tit. Beasts shall leave their element, and barbarians their home, ere I forget Octavianus.]
62. perratis amborum finibus, ‘roaming each o'er the other's lands’, phrase slightly strained, but meaning clear. The Parthian shall wander to the German frontier, the German to Parthia.
63. The Arar (Saône) rises in the Vosges mountains in the E. of France, on the borders of Germany.
64. labatur, common subj. with antequam, of anything which is prevented.
[65–end. M. I shall go to the ends of the earth: shall I ever see my poor home again? a brutal soldier perhaps in possession! this is the result of civil war. Farewell: poor goats, come away! Tit. You might at least stay one more night and feast with me.]
65–67. We shall be scattered to the ends of the earth, some here, some there.
66. The Oaxes of Crete is not known as a river, but there is a town called Axus or Oaxus, and Vergil’s river is doubtless named from this.
There is no need to suspect or emend the reading.
67. The Britons are ‘parted far from all the world’ as being the most northerly country then known, and often proverbially mentioned as remote.
70. ‘At last behold with wonder a few scant ears, my realm of old’. post resumes longo post lempore: regna is playfully pathetic exaggeration for the poor farm he loved: aliquot, either because the land is poor, or because he thinks the new possessor (a soldier) will spoil by ignorance and carelessness his land.
This is the best way of taking a rather artificially expressed and obscure line.
71—72. impius… miles and discordia cives shew that he traces all this misery to the wicked civil wars of recent years.
73. his, indignant, ‘is it for these?"
47. pendere, ‘leaning’, vividly describes the goat perched on its ledge and reaching out to browse.
79. cytisus, ‘lucerne’ or shrubby clover.
80. poteras, he means ‘you can’: but the past is one of the delicacies of speech putting the offer as tho’ the other’s resolve was taken: ‘you might have rested...’.
