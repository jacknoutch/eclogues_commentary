        <comment>deus is Octavianus. To speak of Octavianus as a god to whom lambs will be sacrificed is
        at this date probably only a half playful exaggeration; but afterwards of course the emperor
        Augustus was regularly deified, and even in the Georgics (I. 34) Vergil speaks of the signs
        of the Zodiac crowding up to make room for Augustus. The sacrifice is further explained (43)
        as being 12 days every year, evidently referring to the offerings on the first of every
        month to the household gods or Lares.</comment>

        suffering and confusion caused by the confiscation of the lands and allotment to the
        veterans. See introduction.
        The poor Meliboeus then (with a touch of dramatic pathos) laments his own troubles: he has
        to go on and on (protenus): he is sick and tired (aeger): one of his she goats he can hardly
        pull by a cord (duco vix) having left the new-born twin kids on the hard stones (silice).
        Then with rustic superstition he adds ‘he might have known the coming trouble, from seeing
        the oaks struck by lightning’.</comment>

        de caelo tactas, ‘struck from heaven’, picturesque (perhaps augurial) phrase for
        lightning. Old authorities tell us that the striking of different trees portended different
        misfortunes, the oak being a sign of exile.
        memini praedicere, ‘I remember that they foretold’, the pres. inf. being the regular idiom
        when the thing remembered is part of the person’s own experience, as here.

        <comment>‘its willow blossom rifled by the Hyblaean bees’.
        Hyblaeis, the bees of Hybla in Sicily were famous, and this is what is called the
        ‘literary’ use of epithets: wine is called ‘Massic’ or ‘Falernian’, marble is ‘Parian’, the
        arrow is ‘Cydonian', the bow is ‘Parthian’, &c. not so much to specify the kind, as to
        remind the reader of the Greek poets who speak of them.        
        florem depasta, might be acc. of respect; but considering Vergil's usage, it is much more
        probably the Greek use of acc. of the object after the perf. passive, really an elastic
        extension of the active construction to the passive voice.
        Thus the Greeks say:
        Active
        ἐπιτρέπω σοὶ τὴν ἀρχήν
        ἐγγράφω τῇ δέλτῳ ξυνθήματα
        Passive
        ἐπιτέτραψαι τὴν ἀρχήν
        δέλτος ἐγγεγραμμένη ξυνθήματα
        This usage the Roman poets imitated, as well as the acc. after the middle, which they very
        likely did not distinguish from the other. Other instances of the acc. after passive are
        fusus barbam A. X. 838: inscripti nomina regum Ecl. ΙΙΙ. 106: per pedes traiectus lora A.
        ΙΙ. 272: caesariem effusae G. IV. 337: caeruleos implexae crinibus angues G. IV. 482.
